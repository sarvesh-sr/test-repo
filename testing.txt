this is a sample text to learn how github holds the following as a single thread:
- pr
- issues
- commits
- branches

so this is the second testing, because i merged the pr in the regular way.
with the new branch, i intend to squash merge the pr.

==================================================================================================
this is the third testing. 
what i did is:
1. create a new branch
2. do a new commit, with the commit msg referencing the issue number.
3. push to github.
4. checked in issues section. it mentioned that the issue will be closed after merging with main
5. merged with main, this time squash merged. no reference to the issue anywhere in the pr.
6. issue not closed, even before the branch getting deleted. 

in this try, i'm gonna:
1. create an issue while being at some other branch
2. try the same as before

=================================================================================================
